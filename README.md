# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
This is a simple analysis of kickstarter campaigns, primarily looking at the numbers behind successful and unsuccessful campaigns
For example, what was the average goal for a successful campaign, what was the average donation, did these metrics change by category/subcategory etc. 


For example, the image below displays the outcomes for Theater campaigns. As you can see, the majority of which were successful.
