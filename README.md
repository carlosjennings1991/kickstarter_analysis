# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
This is a simple analysis of kickstarter campaigns, primarily looking at the numbers behind successful and unsuccessful campaigns
For example, what was the average goal for a successful campaign, what was the average donation, did these metrics change by category/subcategory etc. 


For example, the image below displays the outcomes for Theater campaigns. As you can see, the majority of which were successful.

Now, this study was done with for a particualr person, Louise who's interested in her chances of successfully raising enough money for her play. So lets
focus soley on the subcategory of plays. 

## Total Outcomes for Plays (Theater Subcategory)

Overall, the success rate is still above 50% for plays, but campaigns in this subcategory are more likely to fail than campaigns within
the parent category of 'Theater'.

Let's get a bit more granular. Our case study, Louise, wants to know when is the best time to launch her campaign for her play. Luckily, we have that info.

Here we can see that May and June are the best times to launch a campaign for plays.

## Conclusion

Plays that failed often had loftier fundraising goals. It could be that when people donating, they like knowing their donation goes a long way i.e $100 for a play with a goal of $2000 is 5% of the total goal, but that is simply a hypothesis. 

Another key takeaway is that successful campaigns had a much higher number of supporters (63 vs 8), while the donation amounts weren't that much different ($89 vs $73). 

In sum, Louise should launch in May or June, try to bring the budget down as much as possible, and ask as many people as possible for donations.
