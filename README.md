# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

In this analysis, kickstarter campaigns are analyzed by category, subcategory, success rates and launch date. 
The subject for this analysis, Louise, is hoping to successfully raise enough money for her play. So before she launches her campaign, she wants to understand three key issues:
- The success rate for plays overall.
- When is the best time to launch her campaign.
- How much she should ask for.

The raw data for that analysis can be found here - ![Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx](https://github.com/carlosjennings1991/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)
