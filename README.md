# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
This is a simple analysis of kickstarter campaigns, primarily looking at the numbers behind successful and unsuccessful campaigns
For example, what was the average goal for a successful campaign, what was the average donation, did these metrics change by category/subcategory etc. 


For example, the image below displays the outcomes for Theater campaigns. As you can see, the majority of which were successful.

Now, this study was done with for a particualr person, Louise who's interested in her chances of successfully raising enough money for her play. So lets
focus soley on the subcategory of plays. 

## Total Outcomes for Plays (Theater Subcategory)

Overall, the success rate is still above 50% for plays, but campaigns in this subcategory are more likely to fail than campaigns within
the parent category of 'Theater'.

Let's get a bit more granular. Our case study, Louise, wants to know when is the best time to launch her campaign for her play. Luckily, we have that info.
