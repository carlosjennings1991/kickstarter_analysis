# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

In this analysis, kickstarter campaigns are analyzed by category, subcategory, success rates and launch date. 
The subject for this analysis, Louise, is hoping to successfully raise enough money for her play *Fever*. She has already come close to her goal of Â£4,000 but she wants to understand three key issues:

- When is the best time to launch a Theater campaign.
- The success rate for plays overall.
- How the goal affects the outcome.

The raw data for that analysis can be found here - [Kickstarter_Challenge](https://github.com/carlosjennings1991/kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)
